i did not get unit testing

i took the idea of code from ticketing system where data store in a text file
we can search any entry if found success

here we do store various aspect of movie such as imdb rating, name, released year and price of movie

if anyone wants to buy a movie it displays list of movies available

user select anyone of the movie

and also can select number of subscriptions


also it maintains old transctions of the user in another file
